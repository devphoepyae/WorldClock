 * Equirectangular ("plate carrée") projection.

 * Every meridian comes out vertical and every parallel horizontal, which is what
 * makes the latitude/longitude grid and the solar terminator cheap to draw.
 * Results are fractions in `0..1` so callers can scale them to any canvas size.
 *
 * This is a schematic projection drawn entirely on device: no map tiles, no map
 * provider and no API key.
