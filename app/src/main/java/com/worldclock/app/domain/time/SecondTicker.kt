/**
 * Emits the current instant once per second, aligned to the wall-clock second
 * boundary.
 *
 * Because the delay is computed from the current instant rather than being a
 * flat 1000 ms, the clock stays in step with the second hand instead of
 * drifting, and the displayed time never lags by up to a second.
 *
 * The flow is cold: it only ticks while someone collects it. Combined with
 * `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`/`stateIn(WhileSubscribed)` the ticking stops
 * whenever the UI is not visible.
