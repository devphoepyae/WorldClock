/**
 * Keeps the home-screen widget in step with the app's saved cities.
 *
 * The minute ticker alone would leave a newly added city invisible for up to a
 * minute, so the same DataStore stream the screens use also drives a redraw:
 * add Tokyo in the app and the widget has it before the app is closed.
 *
 * Only the three inputs the widget actually depends on are watched — the saved
 * ids, their labels and the 12h/24h choice — so an unrelated change (the theme,
 * the active city) does not redraw a home screen for nothing.
 *
 * @param refresh the redraw itself, injected so this can be tested without a
 *   widget host
 * @param onError called when a redraw fails; injected so the failure is reported
 *   rather than swallowed. A single failed redraw must not end the mirror.
